#Lab 1-1
1. Yes both the dll and .exe match several antivirus signatures.
2. .exe was compiled on Dec 19,2010 along with the .dll
3. .text section raw data section is almost the same as virtual size so likely not packed
4. It uses the Kernel32.dll for creating a file, findnextfile, copyfile,createfilemapping. The .dll imports create process and sleep from Kernel32.dll. Ws2_32.dll is shown in PE insider and is typically used to implement Winsock API for TCP/Ip networking functions. MSVCRT.dll is the C standard library and in this case uses strncmp, malloc,free methods.
5. There is a kernell32.dll string in the .exe and functions like find file and create file likely means the malware tries to create its own kernel132.dll but 1 is replaced with l
6. If you search for strings in the .dll you find the IP address 127.26.152.13 which tells us based on WS2_32.dll the .dll was used to create a backdoor to connect with the ip address.
7. listed in #6


#Lab 1-2
1. Yes the file matched multiple virus signatures.
2. yes its packed with upx based on the section headers being labaled as upx# instead of the usual .data, .text etc.
3. Wininet.dll import is the most suspicious one as it uses InternetOpen and InternetOpenUrl function and is trying to connect to the internet. Using Strings program we find that there is website string http://malwareanalysisbook.com which is the likely target Wininet.dll is being used to connect to.
4. Check for network traffic with Wireshark for the url mentioned above.

#Lab 1-3
1. File matches multiple virus signatures.
2. None of the sections are labeled so its packed. Looking at the header first 3 bytes it spells MZ which means the file is DOS MZ executable. The virtual size of the first section is 0x00003000 but raw data is 0x00000000 which further proves the file is packed
3. Not enough info on imports to make an educated guess on the functionality of the program.
4. Same as above

#Lab 1-4
1. The file matches multiple virus signatures (50/65).
2. The file is not packed
3. The file is apparantly been compiled in August 30, 2019
4. Kernel32.dll imports functions like writefile,createfile,getwindowdirectory,movefile,openprocess which are suspicious and hint at the .exe creating and writing to a file without permission. Also ADVAPI32.dll is the most suspicious one with import functions like openprocesstoken, lookupprivilegevalue, and adjusttokenprivileges. Adjusttokenprivileges in particular is used to enable or disable privileges in the specified access token. Access token contains the security information for a logon session created by a user when they login.
5. Using Strings program you can see the file \system32\wupdmgr.exe that is likely created. Also the url www.malwareanalysisbook.com/updater.exe is likely the location containing malicious files. 
6. After saving the resource section as .bin and opening the file with Cerbero PE Insider, we notice imports like urlmon.dll which use URLDownloadToFile function. This is how the malware downloads the file from the url and saves it as \system32\wupdmgr.exe
